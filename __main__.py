    To obtain the local explanation, we start from the fact that the prediction of a decision tree
    is defined for the path from the root node to a leaf node, and that this path is selected
    analysing at each level a single feature, we proposed to set each of these features as important
    for the prediction. Finally, to quantify this importance, we toke into account the impurity
    criterion.
